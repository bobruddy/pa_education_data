# Tools for analyzing PA Department of Education PDE public data

We will begin with a collection of tools to download the PDE Data and 
organize it in a useful format for analysis. Currently much of this 
data is released in spreadsheets yearly and the format of the spreadsheets
changes year to year. Although I'm finding that since 2011 they have done
a much better job. 

We have one example to start off, but will go through the whole PDE site 
and collate all the datasets they have. 

We will not provide this data, but rather python scripts that will allow 
you to pull down the data yourself.
